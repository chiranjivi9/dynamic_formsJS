            other questions, it is not necessary to repeat the disclosure. If a question or series of questions is inapplicable or
            the response is available elsewhere in the Form , either state that it is inapplicable, include a cross-reference to
            the responsive disclosure, or om it the question or series of questions.<br>
            Be very careful and precise in answering 	all 	questions. Give full and complete answers so that they are
            not	misleading 	under the circumstances involved. Do not discuss any future performance or other anticipated
            event unless you have a reasonable basis to believe that it will 	actually occur within the foreseeable future. If
            any answer requiring 	significant information is	materially inaccurate, incomplete or	misleading , the Company,
            its management and principal shareholders may be liable to investors based on that information.

         <p>INSTRUCTION TO QUESTION 10: 	An issuer	must provide a reasonably detailed description of any intended
            use of proceeds, such that investors are provided with an adequate amount of information to understand how the
            offering proceeds will be used. If an issuer has identified a range of possible uses, the issuer should identify and
            describe each probable use and the factors the issuer	may consider in allocating proceeds among the potential
            uses. If the issuer will accept proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, the issuer must describe the purpose,
            method for allocating oversubscriptions, and intended use of the excess proceeds with similar specificity.<br>
            <br>11. How will the issuer complete the transaction and deliver securities to the investors?<br>
         </p>
         <div class="form-group">
            <label for="hcomplete_trans"></label>

            {{ form.hcancel_icommit.label }}
            {{ form.hcancel_icommit (class= "form-control") }}
         </div>
         <p1>NOTE: Investors may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the deadline
            identified in these offering materials.
            The intermediary will notify investors when the target offering amount has been met.
            If the issuer reaches the target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in the
            offering materials, it may close the offering early if it provides notice about the new
            offering deadline at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline (absent a
            material change that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the
            investment commitment).
            If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to
            the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the issuer upon closing of the offering and the
            investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her investment.
            If an investor does not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material change
            is made to the offering, the investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled and the
            committed funds will be returned.

         <p>INSTRUCTIONS TO QUESTION 29:<br> 1)To determine the financial statements required, the Aggregate Offering Amount for purposes of
            this Question 29 means the aggregate amounts offered and sold by the issuer,
            all entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer, and all predecessors of the issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
            of the Securities Act within the preceding 12-month period plus
            the current maximum offering amount provided on the cover of this Form.
            <br>2) To determine whether the issuer has previously sold securities in reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding for purposes of
            paragraph (c) of this Question 29,
            “issuer” means the issuer, all entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer, and all predecessors of the issuer.
            <br>3) Financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
            must include balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, statements of changes in stock holders’
            equity and notes to the financial statements. If the financial statements are not audited, they shall be
            labeled as “unaudited.”
            <br>4) Issuers offering securities and required to provide the information set forth in row (a) before filing a tax return for the
            most recently completed fiscal year may provide information from the tax return filed
            for the prior year (if any), provided that the issuer provides information from the tax return for the most recently completed fiscal
            year when it is filed, if filed during 	the offering period. An issuer that requested an extension of the
            time to file would not be required to provide information from the tax
            return until the date when the return is filed, if filed during the offering period.

            To qualify as a public accountant that is independent of the issuer for purposes of this Question 29, the
            accountant	must satisfy the independence standards of either:<br>
            (i) Rul e 2-01 of Reg ul ation S-X or<br>
            (ii) the AICPA<br>
            The public accountant that audits or reviews the financial 	statem ents provided by an issuer	m ust be (1)
            duly registered and in good standing 	as a certified public accountant under the laws of the place of his or
            her residence or principal office or (2) in good standing 	and entitled to practice as a public accountant
            under the laws of his or her place of residence or principal office.<br>
            An issuer will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide reviewed financial statement if the
            issuer received a review report that includes modifications. An issuer will not be in compliance with the
            requirement to provide audited financial statements if the issuer received a qualified opinion, an adverse
            opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion.<br>
            The issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer’s intended use of the public accountant’s audit
            or review report in the offering.<br>
            For an offering 	conducted in the first 120 days of a fiscal year, the financial statements provided	may be
            for the two fiscal years prior to the issuer’s	most recently completed fiscal 	year; however, financial
            statements for the two	most recently completed fiscal 	years	must be provided if they are otherwise
            available. If	more than 120 days have passed since the end of the issuer’s	most recently completed fiscal
            year, the financial statements provided	must be for the issuer’s two	most recently com pleted fiscal years.
            If the 120th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall 	be considered the
            120th day for purposes of determining 	the age of the financial statements.<br>
            An issuer	may elect to delay complying 	with any new or revised financial 	accounting 	standard until 	the
            date that a company that is not an issuer (as defined under section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is required to comply
            with such new or revised accounting standard, if such standard also applies to
            companies that are not issuers. Issuers electing such extension of time accommodation must disclose it
            at the time the issuer files its offering statement and apply the election to all standards. Issuers electing
            not to use this accommodation	must forgo this accommodation for all 	financial accounting 	standards and
            may not elect to rely on this accommodation in any future filings.<br>
